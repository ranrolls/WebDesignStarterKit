                    <h3>How is the water quality degrading gradually in our time? </h3>
                    <div><p> Most of the time, tap water is not safe for drinking due to heavy industrial and environmental pollution. Toxic bacteria, chemicals and heavy metals routinely penetrate and pollute our natural water sources making people sick while exposing them to long term health consequences. Municipal water supplied for drinking is also not safe due to poor pipeline quality, parallel sewage pipelines, low maintenance, etc. Contaminants range from naturally-occurring minerals to man-made chemicals and by-products and microbiological organisms like bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, which cause serious diseases like Gastro-enteritis, diarrhea, paratyphoid, dysentery, etc.
                    </p><ul><li>
                        River water, which is our primary source of water, gets contaminated due to various reasons such as direct disposal of sewage by municipalities, excessive discharge of industrial pollutants, use for daily chores like washing, bathing, livestock bathing, garbage disposal, etc.
                        </li><li>Water sourced from groundwater too has deteriorated due to the excessive use of pesticides & insecticides in agriculture, which seep into the groundwater as well as get washed away into the rivers. Decreasing levels of groundwater also attracts natural contaminants present in the earth such as Arsenic, Fluoride, Lead, Heavy Metals, which make the water hard.
    </li><li>Our municipalities are not well equipped to completely purify the water we drink. They are unable to remove harmful dissolved impurities as they use outdated methods of purification such as chlorination and filtration. The pipes in which the water is supplied are rusty which makes the municipal water polluted and the overhead tanks in which water is stored are breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses as they are seldom cleaned.
    </li></ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What types of harmful impurities are found in drinking water?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> Impurities found in drinking water can be broadly classified into:
    <br />
    a) Suspended impurities such as mud, dust, sand, bacteria, viruses, cysts, etc<br />
    b) Dissolved impurities that become soluble in water such as-<br />

    Pesticides (commonly found in borewell water)<br />
    Arsenic & Fluoride (found in groundwell water)<br />
    Heavy Metals salts like mercury, lead, copper, cadmium (from industrial wastes)

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>How can we make water safe for drinking?</h3>
                    <div><p> We can make water safe for drinking by using an effective water purifier, which removes all types of contaminants, be it physical, chemical or microbiological impurities. It should be clearly understood that traditional methods of water purification like boiling can remove only microbial impurities but are ineffective in getting rid of chemical impurities like pesticides and heavy metals, which may be toxic and carcinogenic and have long term impact on health. 
    <br />
    An efficient Water Purifier is based on a combination of effective technologies to remove all types of contaminants from water to render it safe for drinking.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What types of technologies are available for purifying water?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> The most commonly used methods of purification are Chlorination, Boiling, Ultra filtration (UF), Ultra Violet (UV) Disinfection and Reverse Osmosis (RO) Purification.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>Why Boiling alone does not make water fully safe for drinking?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> Boiling kills bacteria and viruses but does not remove harmful dissolved impurities such as Pesticides, Rust, Heavy Metals, Arsenic, Fluoride etc. Just as we cannot remove dissolved salts from water by boiling, similarly we cannot remove dissolved impurities from water by boiling.
    <br />
    Presence of such impurities in water may cause serious diseases such as cholera, hepatitis A & B, jaundice, typhoid and even cancer.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What is Reverse Osmosis Technology?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> Reverse Osmosis is a separation process, which involves the passage of liquid from the lower concentration of dissolved substances to that of a higher concentration, when the two are separated by a semi permeable membrane. Thus, pure water is produced by screening out dissolved salts and other contaminants. 
    <br />
    Reverse Osmosis Membrane is made of Semi permeable membranes, made of cellulose acetate or aromatic polyamide, having pore size of 0.0001 microns in diameter. These can filter out most of the inorganic contaminants, microscopic parasites including viruses, which may cause serious health hazards.
    <br />
    However, while doing so, it removes natural minerals also from the water which are essential to our health.
    <br />
    Thus it renders the water totally mineral-less. Such water can prove to be dangerous in the long run as it can lead to mineral deficiency in the body.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What is UV sterilization?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> UV sterilization utilizes UV light energy to deactivate any microbial contamination in water by altering their DNA structure and making them unable to reproduce and cause diseases. Water after passing through UV radiation gets free of disease causing microorganisms.
    <br />It does kill bacteria and viruses but does not remove dissolved impurities such as Pesticides, Rust, Heavy Metals, Arsenic, Fluoride etc. Also brackish water does not become sweet.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What should be the desired performance of a modern water purifier?
    </h3>
                    <div><p> The need of the hour is to have a purification technology which effectively removes harmful dissolved impurities such as Pesticides, Rust, Heavy Metals, Arsenic, Fluoride, etc apart from other impurities like bacteria and viruses. At the same time, the purifier should retain essential natural minerals in drinking water. It should also work efficiently over a long period of time.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>BLUEBIRD PURE's Innovative Technology – The best solution for water purification.
    </h3>
                    <div><p> BLUEBIRD PURE's Mineral RO water purifiers are based on the ground-breaking computer controlled patented BLUEBIRD PURE's Mineral Technology. It combines the best of both RO and UV purification processes, while eliminating the limitations of a single technology to give 100% Pure, Healthy and Tasty water over a long period of time.

    <br />BLUEBIRD PURE’s Mineral Technology has the following distinct Advantages over conventional RO water purifiers:
    <br />Triple purification: Ensures complete removal of impurities.
    <br />Retention of essential natural minerals: Conventional RO purifiers while removing dissolved impurities also remove essential natural minerals from the water. Whereas in BLUEBIRD PURE water purifiers, while dissolved impurities are removed, essential natural minerals are retained.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>Why is it essential to retain minerals in RO water purifier?</h3>
                    <div><p> Natural minerals are essential for our health. In conventional RO water purifiers, these natural minerals get removed along with dissolved impurities. This makes the water mineral-less. Such water may be harmful to our health and can cause mineral deficiency in the body.

    <br />bluebirdpure's blue moon RO water purifiers are equipped with a TDS controller, which retains essential natural minerals in the purified water.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What can be done with the rejected water coming out of the RO System ?

    </h3>
                    <div><p> The rejected water can be used for household purposes like washing utensils, watering plants, mopping, cleaning, etc.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>Why is it important to choose a water purifier brand that has a good after-sales service backup?

    </h3>
                    <div><p> Continuous availability of pure water to one’s family is essential. Keeping this in mind, it is important to have a good after-sales service back-up, so that in case any problem arises, it can be addressed in the least possible time.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What is the electrical consumption of an RO+UV+UF purifier system ?

    </h3>
                    <div><p> The consumption of electricity in water purifier is negligible ascompared to any other electric equipment in your house. Such a Water purifier system has a power consumption of 25 watts. It consumes 1 unit current only in 40 hours, in which time it can purify 4800 litres of drinking water. 

    <br />On an average, we use 20 litres of purified water per day in our house. According to this calculation, a household normally require 7300 liters of water per year. So the electric consumption will be approximately 1.52 units per year (Power consumption may vary slightly for different models).

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>What if some parts stop functioning?

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>Where can I buy Bluebird pure purifier/ cartridge?

    </h3>
                    <div><p> You can purchase BLUEBIRD PURE Water Purifier/ cartridges through any of our authorized dealers. You should buy only genuine BLUEBIRD PURE cartridges/ components for best and trouble free performance.

                    </p>
                </div>
                
                    <h3>Why not bottled water ?

    </h3>
                    <div><p> Generally, the bottled water sold by the larger and reputed manufacturers are safe to drink. The problem is with the dodgy smaller outfits whose manufacturing methods do not conform to high quality standards. The problem with water is that it can be contaminated very easily. Unless a high degree of cleanliness is maintained in the production process, there’s no guarantee that the water will be safe to drink.
    <br />Refilling Water in Used Bottles
    <br />Another problem is that it’s not very difficult to refill used bottles and seal them. The people who refill them don’t care much about the water sources, and there’s a good chance you could end up drinking water filled with bacteria and other pollutants.
    <br />According to one recent government survey, one in 10 bottled water samples failed to meet quality standards. So one should not assume that just because it’s in a bottle, it is safe to drink. Your best bet for pure water is to get yourself a trusted water purifier that uses RO technology.
